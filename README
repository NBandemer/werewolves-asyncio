*** This refactor was done in PYTHON3 ***
*** We would NOT like our code distributed in the future.  ***

*** OUR REFACTOR ***
The focus of the refactoring was to implement the asnycio library (avaliable in >=python3.4) in order to fix various vulnerabilities that arose from multithreading using pipes. 

The existing system has been replaced with an asynchronous socket server. Each client connects to the locally running socket server (this could be easily extended to support external connections) and has instances of a StreamReader and a StreamWriter in order to handle two-way communication with the server.

In its most basic form, async defined functions are run from an event pool, and are able to pause execution and give up the executing thread to another function in the event pool. This allows for concurrent execution of IO bound tasks as well as game logic without multithreading.

*** INSTRUCTIONS ***
1) Rerun the modified install.sh to support python3 and install necessary packages
2) Run server.py as the moderator
3) Run client.py as a player
